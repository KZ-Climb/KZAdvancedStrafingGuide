		<h1 id="about-author"class="title">About The Author</h1><hr>
		<p class="textbox">My online alias is <strong>UdNeedaMiracle</strong>, and I am a fairly well known player in the Kreedz Climbing Mod in Counter-Strike Global Offensive.  Many people recognize me for my jumpstats and strafing skills, as well as the large amount of time I have dedicated to practicing them, primarily in the House of Climb 2 NA server.  

		<br><br>I am generally considered to be one of the best at strafing in CSGO KZ, and I am currently <strong>holding several world records for jumpstats</strong>.  I am also in the top 5 for no bind and no -forward bind Longjump, no bind and bind single Bunnyhop, bind and no bind backwards longjump, and am a part of the top 10 for nearly all jumpstats categories.  

		<br><br>Apart from my jumpstats, I am also the <strong>co-creator of the Longjump Crouch Bind</strong> along with doc.mad, and I am responsible for the creation of the first (although private) Longjump Practice Server in CSGO.</p>



		<h1 id="why-write" class="title">Why I Wrote This Guide</h1><hr>
		<p class="textbox">In order to reach the level of skill that I have, I had to play a very high number of hours.  I estimate that I have spent a <strong>total of over 2200 hours practicing jumpstats</strong> in this game.  Unfortunately, I had the time on my hands to do this due to health problems.  Most people do not have this kind of time on their hands, nor the desire to spend that long to develop skills in a videogame.  

		<br><br>When I first started playing KZ, there were no longjumpers who took it seriously.  The best anybody could manage was around  277 units.  Now, the world record is nearly 290 units. Practicing jumpstats has come a long way recently.  

		<br><br>At the time that I started longjumping, not only were there no serious players yet, but <strong>there was no understanding of what led to a particularly high jump</strong>.  The most common advice given on servers was to try to do more strafes, or try to improve your sync. If you were lucky, you got to hear one of the best responses which you could get to this question, “just jump longer.”  

		<br><br>I consider myself the first player to take jumpstats practicing very seriously, in the sense that I was playing the game purely to practice them, with no intentions of ever running maps in KZ, playing competitive, or doing any other thing of the sort.  Until players started to come from previous Counter-Strike games, I was the only one.  <strong>This means that while there were players who were better than me, there were none who were qualified to give meaningful advice.</strong>  Because of this, I had to learn a lot of things about what was an ideal jump on my own through trial and error, and this took a lot of time and effort.  It is the difference between practicing longjumping with no understanding of what you need to improve, and <strong>aiming to improve longjumping by practicing the physical execution of concepts</strong> that will lead to a good longjump.  

		<br><br>In my case, it took me over 2000 hours to reach an extreme skill level.  <strong>Somebody else who is using my knowledge from day one will likely be able to reach my skill level in a quarter of the time.</strong>  I am writing this guide because I have lost interest in pushing my jumpstat skills any farther.  The small improvements I have been able to make in the past few months show me that I am near the limit of what I am capable of, and I can not justify continuing.  At least for the time being, I am done with actively trying to improve my records.  However, I do not want my practice to be wasted, and I do not want anybody else to have to play as much as I did to achieve what I did.  It is just a game after all.</p>

		<h1 id="who-will-help" class="title">Who Will This Guide Help?</h1><hr>
		<p class="textbox">This guide is targeted towards players of KZ who wish to improve their jumpstats for the purposes of competing with the best for world records, and for those who wish to reach a high enough level of strafing skill to be able to compete in KZ maps for world record times within a short span of time.  Keep in mind that <strong>there is no substitute for real practice</strong>, but practicing with the right mindset, in the right conditions, and with the right prior knowledge will allow you to achieve great things in much less time than it would take somebody lacking these things.  Practice does not make perfect, smart practice leads to consistency.</p>
